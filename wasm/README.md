This directory has some output wasm and wat files. They are generated by the `Makefile` in this directory and `bigint.h` in the parent directory.

# Dependencies

### CMake

CMake is required if you are compiling dependencies. This is usually available in system repositories, eg `apt install cmake`.

### LLVM8+

We use `LLVM8` or newer to compile to wasm. This should be in syste repositories. You may also be able to find binaries online. As a last resort, you can compile it following the standard instructions below.

```
git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git	# big download
mkdir llvm-project/build && cd llvm-project/build
cmake -G 'Unix Makefiles' -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang;libcxx;libcxxabi;lld" ../llvm
make -j4	# this takes hours, may fail and need a restart with the same make command, may crash your system if you don't have enough ram or disk.
cd ../..
```

### Wabt

We use wabt to transform between wasm binary and text format. Specifically `wasm2wat` and `wat2wasm`. And, optionally, we use `wasm-interp` to execute the wasm. You can download a release of wabt binaries, or compile it as follows.

```
git clone https://github.com/webassembly/wabt.git       #18MB
cd wabt
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF ..
make    # should output executables wasm2wat, wat2wasm, and wasm-interp
cd ../..
```

### Binaryen

We use binaryen tool `wasm-opt` to optimize Wasm binaries. You can download a release of the binaries, or compile it as follows.
```
git clone https://github.com/webassembly/binaryen.git       #141 MB
cd binaryen
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make    # should output executable bin/wasm-opt
cd ../..
```

### __multi3()

Because Wasm doesn't support multiplication `u64xu64->u128`, so if you need it, we use the precompiled version of builtin `__multi3()`. See the makefile for the exact command where `wasm-ld` links against this file.
```
wget https://github.com/CraneStation/wasi-sdk/releases/download/wasi-sdk-5/libclang_rt.builtins-wasm32-wasi-5.0.tar.gz
tar -xvzf libclang_rt.builtins-wasm32-wasi-5.0.tar.gz
```


# Compile

llvm, wabt, and binaryen binaries are called in the Makefile. Either (i) these binaries are already visible, (ii) you update your `PATH` system variable with maths to these binaries, (iii) you manually set the paths to the binaries at the top of the Makefile, or (v) you set give these path variables as arguments to make.

Then you can compile specific functions.

```
make mul256_32bitlimbs
make montmul256_64bitlimbs
make montsquare256_32bitlimbs
```

Edit the makefile to create your own recipes.


# Bench

Edit the makefile and `bench.c` to creating your own benchmarks. Then compile and run the benchmark in wabt as follows.

```
make montmul256_32bitlimbs_bench
```

To benchmark in a browser, first create a server from this directory.

```
python3 -m http.server
```

Then in your browser, visit: http://0.0.0.0:8000/ or whatever address python outputs, and adjust the filename and funcname, and click the run button, which should print a runtime.
